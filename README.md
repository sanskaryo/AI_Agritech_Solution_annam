Smart Agriculture Decision Support System


# 🌾 SmartFarm AI - Precision Agriculture Platform

**Annam.AI Hackathon 2025 Submission**

Welcome to **SmartFarm AI**, an intelligent decision-support system designed to empower farmers through AI and IoT-driven insights. This platform assists in optimizing crop health, irrigation, and post-harvest management using real-time data and predictive analytics.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a modular, extensible platform that helps address key agricultural challenges by integrating:

- **AI/ML models** for disease detection, irrigation scheduling, and yield prediction
- **IoT sensor data** for monitoring soil moisture, pH, and environmental conditions
- **Post-harvest analysis** tools for grading and storage decisions
- **Farmer-friendly dashboard** for actionable insights

This solution is particularly designed for smallholder farmers and aims to promote sustainable, data-informed farming.
